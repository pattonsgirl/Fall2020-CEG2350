## After doing "reset" from Learner Lab Page:

AWS light is grey (and staying grey)

- Click "End Lab"
- Click "reset" again

Initialization Failed / account is still in cleanup

- wait
- no really
- 5 minutes?
- Go back in, start lab should now have the vocareum sign

## Troubleshooting instances:

Instance is running, when SSH command is run, connection timeout error shown

- in instance actions, select reboot
- New IP will be assigned (at least this has been the behavior so far)
- log in with new IP
