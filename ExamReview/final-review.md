## Processes

1. Task Manager (Linux [top] vs. Windows)
2. init process / kernel level vs user level processes
   a. parent vs child process
3. System calls (way for programs / APIs to interact with the operating system)
   a. systemd - systemctl & journalctl
   b. Fork & exec
4. Commands: kill, ps, top, nice, bg, fg, jobs, nohup, ~~killall~~, screen
5. Preemptive (interruptible) and non-preemptive scheduling, priorities, signals
6. CPU & kernel memory management
7. Thread vs Fork
8. Single CPU multi-tasking
9. Multiple CPUs ~~and SMP (Symmetric multiprocessing)~~

## Git (version control)

1. Git servers vs. clients
2. Basic commands: push, pull, commit, add, init, clone, **branching**, merge conflicts, ~~, custom configurations~~

## Networking

1. Host names, IP addresses, Subnets, DNS, URLs
2. Protocols: HTTP vs HTTPS
3. TCP and UDP
4. Ports vs sockets, clients and servers, secure shell, sftp
   • Application opens a socket which is connected to a port
5. X11 in terms of graphical “forwarding” and role of a GUI
6. Web browsers (URLs, SSL certs) and clients (ping, wget, traceroute)
7. Physical pieces of a network
   • hosts, routers, switches, ISPs, wireless, LAN
8. Firewalls
9. OSI layers (encapsulation / packets, application, transport, network, datalink, physical)

## System Management

1. Updates (Linux vs. Windows)
2. Installing packages with make
3. Virus scanning & types of computer diseases
4. Creating archives, password locking files
5. System restore (automatic, manual, backups)
6. Windows Registry
7. Boot scripts & init.d
8. Open source movement
9. Torrents

## Computer-ception

1. Virtual machines (GUI style) and hypervisors
2. Containers
3. Cloud computing (Google, AWS, Azure) & basic terminology
   • Storage buckets, cloud networking, heavy computation
