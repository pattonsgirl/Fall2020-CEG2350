# Lab 09 - NOT FINALIZED

## Lab Procedure

Document your progress in a plain text file named `Lab08-LastName.txt`  
where LastName is your last name

At the top of the file please enter your personal details as follows:

```
Name: Your name
Email: Your email

```

**Where questions are presented, answer them in your lab notes. For each step, include the command you used to perform the direction or answer the question posed.** If you did something "wrong" make a note of it in your lab. These are learning experiences.

If you've lost or forgotten your key, you'll need to provision a new stack in AWS Educate and create a new key.  
See [Remaking your AWS Educate environment](../../..) for instructions.
